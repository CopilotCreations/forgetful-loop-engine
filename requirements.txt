# Lethe - Python Dependencies

# No external dependencies required for core functionality
# The system uses only Python standard library modules

# Optional: If you want tracemalloc support for memory tracking
# (already in standard library for Python 3.4+)

# For development and testing, see requirements-dev.txt
